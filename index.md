## What is this?
In this workshop, you will learn two lessons:

1. You will learn to differentiate between arguments and non-arguments
2. You will learn how to use a standard form to dissect arguments

This is why we call it critical reading of papers.

## Instructions

Lesson 1: Identifying Arguments

You will read five passages in this section; each passage will be longer and more complex than the previous one.
After you have read each passage, identify the concluding statement and a reason behind the concluding statement.

Write the concluding statement and the reasoning in the worksheet. You can copy paste from the webpage if you want.

Lesson 2: Constructing a standard form

You will read three passages, that would be in the form of abstracts of three articles published recently. In the form (standard_form.txt), fill in the headings: the final conclusion, the explicit premises, the implicit premises, & intermediate conclusions.

> ## Prerequisites
> You must understand the concepts of identifying arguments and explanations in passages of text
> You must understand how to construct a standard form to capture arguments
> You must download and keep ready the two worksheets: identifying_argument.txt, and standard_form.txt
