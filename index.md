## Introduction

In this workshop, you will learn two lessons:

1. You will learn to differentiate between arguments and non-arguments
2. You will learn how to use a standard form to dissect arguments

This is why we call it critical reading of papers.

## Instructions

Lesson 1: Identifying Arguments

You will read a passage in this section; after you have read the passage, identify the concluding statement and a reason behind the concluding statement.

Write the concluding statement and the reasoning in the worksheet. You can copy paste from the webpage if you want.

Lesson 2: Constructing a standard form

You will read a passage. In the form (standard_form.txt), fill in the headings: the final conclusion, the explicit premises, the implicit premises, & intermediate conclusions.

Lesson 3: Identify the epidemiological study designs

You will read three abstracts and will discuss the study design, and whether you can re-design the study. Use the study_design.docx form you downloaded to work with it. 

Check the setup link to download the worksheets.
