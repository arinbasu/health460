## Types of statements without reasoning

- Descriptions have only facts; these are simple statements that expresses a third person statement or refer to some conditions.
- Summaries are extended descriptions; you should look for summaries in the methods section of the paper or in any space where the author has just stated a series of facts connected together
- Opinions are first person perspectives that expresse a position only
- Beliefs are first person perspectives that express a position plus moral connotation
- Rhetorical manipulation or content are statements that are aimed to put an emotional perspective

## Statements and passages with reasoning

- Arguments are statements with reasoning and persuasion
- Explanations are statements with reasoning but does not include persuasion

> ## Hint: how can we locate each element?
> Look for indicator words. Indicator words are the words or expressions such as "Given", "Given that", "Because", and similar words that give away that a reason is being presented. Also look for emotion laden information but no rationale or reasoning being provided
> Look for a conclusion; if there is a conclusion, then there is an explanation or an argument.
